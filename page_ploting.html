								<p>These examples are part of the assignments I did in the
									 "Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python" course by University of Michigan on Coursera.

								<p>The first plot shows how temperatures have varied near Ann Arbor
									(Michigan - United States) in 2015 vs 2005-2014. An average of
									the values ​​between 2005 and 2014 is represented by the shaded
									area between the red and blue lines (maximum and minimum)
									the points represent temperatures of the year 2015 that
									exceed the average of the years 2005-2014.</p>

								<p>This second plot applies some of the concepts explained in the paper
								<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Ferreira_Fisher_Sample_Oriented_Tasks.pdf">
									"Ferreira, N., Fisher, D., & Konig, A. C. (2014, April). [Sample-oriented
								task-driven visualizations: allowing users to make better, more confident decisions.]</a>
								In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (pp. 571-580).
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI7GAs-va-Q">(Video)</a><br />
								In this paper the authors describe the challenges users face when trying to
								make judgements about probabilistic data generated through samples. As an example,
								they look at a bar chart of four years of data (replicated below in Figure 1).
								Each year has a y-axis value, which is derived from a sample of a larger dataset.
								For instance, the first value might be the number votes in a given district or riding for 1992,
								with the average being around 33,000. On top of this is plotted the 95% confidence interval
								for the mean.<br />
								The result is an interactive plot, don't miss seeing the code!

								<p>In this example, it is intended to show how a simple data can
									 be plotted using the principles of Cairo, improving various aspects of the plot.
								<a href="https://www.coursera.org/lecture/python-plotting/the-truthful-art-alberto-cairo-GqvPs">
									See the lecture "The Truthful Art (alberto Cairo)"</a>.<br />

									This visualization was concerned with answering the question
									of How the number of followers of the main branches of religion
									varied in relation to the population in the last 30 years.
									'thearda.com' was scraped for data concerning the region Ann Arbor
									and the last 30 years of data. Any new tradition of news religion
									bodies was dropped from the analysis in order to provide a more level
									comparison between the traditions. A ratio between the sum of the
									Adherents grouped by the traditions and the population was plotted
									to help the reader identify any major trends in the adherents ratio.<br />

									The plot indicates that, in general, all religions have a decrease
									in relation to the size of the population. Except for 'other' where
									the new religions are classified showing an increased rate. More
									 information should be taken into account to draw conclusions,
									 since Ann Arbor is a university city, with 33% of its employment
									 in education services.</p>

									<h3>Cairo's principles</h3>
									<h4>Truthfulness:</h4>

									Because the population grows, it is logical that adherents of
									religions grow. But, in reality, they do not grow at the same
									speed as the population, this is why the ratio is shown.<br />

									<h4>Beauty:</h4>
									The plot was created thinking about simplicity, small details
									like removing the frame of the labels and the type of line '-o' were taken into account.<br />

									<h4>Functionality:</h4>
									To give it more functionality the color style 'seaborn-colorblind' was used.<br />

									<h4>Insightfulness:</h4>
									I think that seeing the different religious traditions plotted
									 in ratios with respect to the population gives us that feeling
									 of eureka, seeing that in general religions lose adherents in
									 relation to the size of the population, and as new religions
									 'other' begin to grow to generate pluralism religious and cultural.<br />
